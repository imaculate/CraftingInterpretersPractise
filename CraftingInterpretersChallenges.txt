switchStmt     → "switch" "(" expression ")"
                 "{" switchCase* defaultCase? "}" ;
switchCase     → "case" expression ":" statement* ;
defaultCase    → "default" ":" statement* ;

Reading and writing the ip field is one of the most frequent operations inside the bytecode loop. Right now, we access it through a pointer to the current CallFrame. That requires a pointer indirection which may force the CPU to bypass the cache and hit main memory. That can be a real performance sink.

Ideally, we’d keep the ip in a native CPU register. C doesn’t let us require that without dropping into inline assembly, but we can structure the code to encourage the compiler to make that optimization. If we store the ip directly in a C local variable and mark it register, there’s a good chance the C compiler will accede to our polite request.

Wrapping every ObjFunction in an ObjClosure introduces a level of indirection that has a performance cost. That cost isn’t necessary for functions that do not close over any variables, but it does let the runtime treat all calls uniformly.

Change clox to only wrap functions in ObjClosures that need upvalues. How does the code complexity and performance compare to always wrapping functions? Take care to benchmark programs that do and do not use closures. How should you weight the importance of each benchmark? If one gets slower and one faster, how do you decide what trade-off to make to choose an implementation strategy?

Research how Ruby allows "open" classes that can be modified after the fact.

Make Lox favor supermethods by default and then user inner() [opposite of super()]to call subclass methods.

Fire up your profiler, run a couple of benchmarks, and look for other hotspots in the VM. Do you see anything in the runtime that you can improve?

Many strings in real-world user programs are small, often only a character or two. This is less of a concern in clox because we intern strings, but most VMs don’t. For those that don’t, heap allocating a tiny character array for each of those little strings and then representing the value as a pointer to that array is wasteful. Often, the pointer is larger than the string’s characters. A classic trick is to have a separate value representation for small strings that stores the characters inline in the value.

Starting from clox’s original tagged union representation, implement that optimization. Write a couple of relevant benchmarks and see if it helps.
